## Abstract
Western music has been under the radar of computational musicology for quite some time now. However, Indian Classical Music is one of the prominent areas that is not extensively researched. In this manuscript, Deep Learning models are used in Indian Classical Music. It is often important to identify the Thaats and Ragas of a song computationally for further applications such as sentiment-based recommendation and identification. The Deep Learning model implemented here analyzes the Mel Spectrogram, STFT Spectrogram, and Chromagram of any song/music piece to classify it into different required categories with the help of CNN. On extensive testing, it is inferred that the proposed system is highly effective in the identification with high accuracy.
